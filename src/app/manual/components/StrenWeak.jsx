        <span className="font-bold">Adaptability: </span> I adapt extremely
        quickly to new situations and can take charge if needed, even if the
        situation is tense or challenging.

        <span className="font-bold"> Jack of all trades:</span> I know quite a

      <li className="lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-6 lg:mt-4 mb-2">
        <span className="font-bold">Overextending myself:</span> I get excited
        by lots of things and sometimes (okay, almost all the time) that means I
        spread myself too thin.

        <span className="font-bold">Impostor syndrome:</span> Like many

        improvements for example.
