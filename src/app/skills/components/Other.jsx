        I also have experience with various technical tools and practices,
        including Atmel Studio for embedded development, containerization with
        Docker, and databases like PostgreSQL. My skill set extends to UI/UX
        design and prototyping using Figma and similar software, unit testing,
        and game development with the Godot engine. Additionally, I have
        experience working with APIs, version management using Git, and a solid
        understanding of cybersecurity principles. Accessibility and creating
        inclusive designs are also areas I prioritize in my work.
