        Through my (fairly) short life I have seen a lot of stuff, for better or
        worse. I have studied in two universities, and worked more jobs than I
        have fingers in my right hand. Right now I am focusing on advancing my
        CS studies while working on personal projects on the side.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        As a developer I am a fairly "skip to the good part"-type. The good part
        being the actual programming. Lately I have started to focus more on
        modularity and responsiveness in my projects. I would like to learn more
        machine learning and cyber security, and these are the things that I try
        to gradularly add to my schedule.
      </p>
